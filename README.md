## Data-Analysis-with-SQL

This repository contains solution to all the case study questions from the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) which is created by [Dannyma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/). Danny is a data scientist and has trained a plethora of data aspirants around the globe. 

These case studies are created to test the knowledge of SQL as well as to show the day-to-day work of a SQL developer, data analyst and data scientist.

There are total 8 case studies, each containing a different database. There are several questions in each case study and these are the questions that could be asked in a real business to know more about the data, to get the insights in order to grow the business. 

I firmly believe if one is able to solve all these questions, then he has a strong knowledge of SQL, data analytics using SQL and data cleaning using SQL.

#### Specai Thanks: All the credits goes to [Dannyma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/) for creating this amazing challenge, to test our knowledge about SQL and learn some new things about SQL.
